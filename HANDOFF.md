# Handoff

_Last updated: 2026-10-17, session 4 (Phase 5 verified; commit pending the user's OK)._

## Where things stand
- **Phases 1-4 of 10 are built, verified and committed** (`736d6d5`, `3815fdd`, `b6dca4e`, `b72466a`, docs `a8b7c6e`).
- **Phase 5 is built and verified** in worktree `.claude/worktrees/openterm-phases-5-10-a49ca4`, branch
  `claude/openterm-phases-5-10-a49ca4` (on top of `a8b7c6e`, so it contains Phases 1-4). Continue there.
- Phases 3 and 4 live on branch `claude/openterm-phase-3-4-621f59` (worktree), **not on `main` yet**.
  The main checkout has the Phase 3 files uncommitted on `main` (identical to `b6dca4e`). To bring
  `main` up to date: discard those local copies on `main` (`git checkout -- .` and delete the untracked
  Phase 3 files), then `git merge claude/openterm-phase-3-4-621f59` (fast-forward). No git remote. The git identity (ankithrbharadwaj) is set for this repo only.
- Latest verification (Phase 5 tree):
  - Backend: 66 pytest passed (4 xdist workers, ~9.5 s), ruff clean.
  - Frontend: 36 vitest passed, tsc clean, 23 Playwright passed (`e2e/phase5.spec.ts` green on first run).
  - Bench: 17/17 budgets PASS, none regressed (see `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` Phase 5).

## Done
| Phase | Contents |
|---|---|
| 1 Scaffold | Shell UI (top bar, command line, clock + market lights, status bar), tiling workspace (split/close/focus/resize/maximize, panel history), command parser `[N:] SEC [MKT] FN [ARGS]`, fuzzy autocomplete, history, `keybindings.json`, PERF HUD/panel, `scripts/bench.mjs`, CI workflow |
| 2 Data core | Provider adapters (Yahoo, Nasdaq), router with fallback + circuit breaker, token buckets, LRU + SQLite WAL cache, SWR envelopes `{data, source, as_of, age_s, stale, fallback_from}`, request coalescing, `/api/quote|history|search|sources|log`, fixture mode, `SOURCES` and `LOG` screens, live ticker search with prefetch |
| 3 First functions | Yahoo protobuf streamer (hand-decoded), REST poll fallback, SYNTHETIC load stream, hub with one upstream subscription per symbol and per-client coalescing; `/api/profile`; frontend tick store (per-frame batching), canvas virtualized `Grid`, `Q` (live monitor), `DES`, `QR`, `GP` (lightweight-charts, indicators in a Web Worker, compare, log, crosshair, keyboard pan/zoom), `PERF GRID/CHART` load views |
| 4 Workspace | SQLite migrations 3-4 (`layouts`, `history`), `backend/openterm/userdata.py`, `/api/layouts[/{name}]` GET/PUT/DELETE, `/api/cmdhistory` GET/POST; `LAYOUT`/`MONITOR` `SAVE|LOAD|DEL name` (bare name = LOAD, bare `LAYOUT` = list panel with J/K, Enter, Del-twice, S), `Ctrl+S` (re-save current named layout, else prompts) / `Ctrl+O` (prompts `LAYOUT LOAD ` with name autocomplete), layout name in the status bar; command history moved to SQLite (batched writes, `sendBeacon` on exit, one-time upload of the old localStorage history); Playwright tests for layouts, history and Ctrl+Shift+Arrows resizing; bench gate for layout load |
| 5 Boards + lists | Watchlists (SQLite, `WL` grammar), news (`N`: RSS / Yahoo RSS / GDELT), `MOV` (Nasdaq movers), `CRYP` (CoinGecko, Binance), boards `WEI` `FX` `CMDTY`, `FXC` cross matrix, shared `quoteRows.ts`; pytest-xdist, fully parallel Playwright |

## Phase 5 details (WL, N, WEI, MOV, FX/FXC, CRYP, CMDTY)

**Built and verified:**
- Backend: **66 pytest passed, ruff clean** (42 old + 24 in `tests/test_phase5.py`).
  - Migration 5 `watchlists`; `userdata.py` watchlist CRUD (max 500 symbols, aliases resolved, deduped);
    `/api/watchlists[/{name}]` GET / PUT `{symbols}` / PATCH `{add, remove}` (add creates) / DELETE.
  - `providers/news.py`: `rss` (5 publisher feeds, merged newest first, partial failures listed in `failed`),
    `yahoo_rss` (per-symbol, publisher = link domain), `gdelt` (keyword; `max_wait` 6 s, `timeout` 20 s, throttle text = rate_limited).
    `/api/news` (`?symbol=` | `?q=` | none = top), TTL 120 s, not found = `NO HEADLINES FOUND`.
  - `nasdaq.movers()` + `/api/movers` (tabs GAINERS LOSERS ACTIVE DOLLAR NDX100, per-tab "data as of"), TTL 60 s.
  - `providers/crypto.py`: `coingecko` then `binance` (USD/USDT only); `/api/crypto?vs=` (allowed list in `crypto.VS`), TTL 60 s.
  - Provider base: `get_bytes`, per-class `timeout` and `max_wait`. Error bodies now include `detail` (each provider's reason).
  - Fixtures recorded from the real endpoints (see `providers/fixtures.py` `PATHS`, `YAHOO_RSS`, `GDELT`, `COINGECKO`);
    `yahoo_spark.json` now also holds all 74 board symbols. `config.yaml`: new fallback orders, TTLs, `news.feeds` comment.
  - Existing tests changed only where they pin the provider set / migration list (`test_api.py`, `test_userdata.py`).
- Frontend: **tsc clean; vitest 36 passed** (24 old + `command/watchlists.test.ts`, `functions/boards.test.ts`).
  - `command/watchlistArgs.ts` (pure parser) + `command/watchlists.ts` (API actions, `watchlistList`, `watchlistVersion` stores);
    `execute.ts` handles `WL ...` (edit then show the list; no duplicate history entry if the panel already shows it);
    command-line autocomplete for `WL <name>` / `WL DEL <name>`; prefetch now only for RECENT/SEC suggestions (was also prefetching layout names).
  - `Grid` mirrors the selected row into `.grid .sr`. `functions/quoteRows.ts` extracted from Q (Q refactored onto it, same behaviour).
  - Panels written: `WL.tsx` (index with Del-twice delete; list view with D remove, U undo, A add, S sort, E CSV),
    `N.tsx` (Enter opens the article in a new tab, NEW items highlighted, 60 s poll, F5 fresh, error + detail),
    `MOV.tsx` (1-5 / Tab switch tabs), `CRYP.tsx` (Enter = `SYM-USD GP`), `Board.tsx` + `WEI.tsx` `FX.tsx` `CMDTY.tsx`
    (sections skipped by J/K, Enter = GP), `FXC.tsx` (cross matrix, recomputed on leg ticks, Enter = GP vs USD).
  - `format.ts` `fmtRate`; `api.ts` news/movers/crypto/watchlist calls (`fresh` flag skips the client cache); styles `.sr .tabs .summary`.
  - `functions/registry.ts`: all eight wired with `load` and `argsSchema`.
  - `e2e/phase5.spec.ts` (8 tests, mocked routes + WebSocket), green.

**Bench baseline for Phase 6** (Phase 5 tree, 2026-10-17): 17/17 PASS. Bundle 84.8 KB gz; backend p95
health/quote/history 0.7/0.9/2.2 ms; cold start 92.5 ms; keystroke 14.4 ms (10.5 under load); cached / cold-network
command to paint 17.5 / 12.6 ms; tick-to-pixel 37.5 ms; frame p95 16.7-16.8 ms everywhere; long tasks 0; heap 6.0 MB;
ticks 3,992/s; layout load 35.8 ms.

## Next
Phases 6-10 in order:
- 6: FA via SEC EDGAR XBRL company facts (needs `SEC_USER_AGENT`), FIL filings, HDS/OWN.
- 7: MACRO/FRED (key), ECO calendar, RATES curve, ERN.
- 8: PORT (CSV import/export), ALRT with desktop notifications.
- 9: EQS screener, CORR, COMP, HIST, CSV export everywhere.
- 10: Themes UI, vim mode, keybinding overrides, SETTINGS, Docker, Tauri, release notes, full perf pass.

## Decisions already made (don't relitigate)
- Stooq is dropped (bot check). The zero-key chain is Yahoo, then Nasdaq (US only, daily history only).
- Keystroke echo is gated at 16.7 ms (one 60 Hz frame), measured from keydown to the start of the next frame.
- Frame time is gated at p95 < 20 ms (60 Hz = 16.7 ms; above 25 ms is a dropped frame).
- Backend latency is gated server-side.
- 9 panels is the maximum (focus-by-number 1-9). The bench runs the 200-symbol load over 9 panels.
- Memory budget is checked as JS heap. Whole-process memory waits for the Tauri build.
- No React.lazy/Suspense for panels (300 ms reveal throttle). Use the registry loader.
- Daily charts never invent a new bar from ticks. Intraday bars are bucketed.
- Lightweight Charts attribution is text (in the GP status line and the README), with the logo off.
- Command history lives on `/api/cmdhistory` (`/api/history` is price bars). Table name is `history`.
- Named layouts are in SQLite. The live (unnamed) workspace still autosaves to localStorage so cold
  start never waits on the backend; recent-securities autocomplete hints also stay in localStorage.
- A saved layout keeps only each panel's current view (no back/forward history). Loading validates
  the tree in the frontend (`state/layoutState.ts`); unknown functions become empty panels.
- Layout load is gated at 100 ms (the cached-command budget). Layout names: 1-32 of A-Z 0-9 _ . -, uppercased.
- Watchlists are in SQLite (same name rules as layouts). Grammar: `WL`, `WL NAME`, `WL NAME ADD|RM SYM...`,
  `WL DEL NAME`; `AAPL WL TECH ADD` adds the typed security, never the panel's sticky one.
- MOV uses Nasdaq only (Yahoo predefined screeners returned empty results on 2026-10-17). US only.
- N shows headline, teaser and link only; Enter opens the publisher's page in a new tab. `N` with a sticky
  security shows that security's news; `N TOP` forces top stories; `N words` is a GDELT search.
- CRYP polls REST (CoinGecko, then Binance); it does not mix in Yahoo stream ticks. Enter charts Yahoo `SYM-USD`.
- FXC crosses are triangulated through USD and labelled so. Boards (WEI, FX, CMDTY) are fixed lists in `boards.ts`.
- Rate-limited providers still surface as `PROVIDER DOWN` (pinned by `test_core.py`); the reason is in `detail`.

## Risks / open items
- Yahoo endpoints are unofficial (stream, spark, chart, quoteSummary crumb flow) and can break without notice. Non-US symbols have no zero-key fallback yet.
- Market-hours lights ignore holidays.
- If the backend is down at page load, command history starts empty for that session (it is not
  re-fetched on reconnect); new commands are still kept and uploaded once the backend answers.
- The CI workflow has never run (no remote). Bench timing on GitHub runners is untested.
- Shell scripts `scripts/setup` and `scripts/dev` are untested on macOS/Linux.
- GDELT throttles hard (429s even when spaced). Its fixture `gdelt_nvidia.json` is a real 5-article answer captured
  while probing; `gdelt_429.json` is its real throttle text.
- Yahoo screeners (`v1/finance/screener/predefined/saved`) should be re-checked on a weekday; if they return rows,
  they could become MOV's primary source (record a weekday fixture first).
- The fixtures were recorded with a one-off script that is not in the repo. To refresh one, fetch the same URL the
  provider builds and save `{"status", "body"}` (JSON) or `{"status", "content_type", "text"}` (XML/text).

## How to look at the app
Run `.\scripts\dev.ps1`, then open http://localhost:5173. To get a screenshot without the preview pane,
run a small Playwright script against a production build (`npx vite preview --port 4173 --host 127.0.0.1`).
The pattern is in `frontend/e2e/*.spec.ts`. Current look: `docs/screenshot-phase3.png`.
